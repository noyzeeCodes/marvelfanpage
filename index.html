	<p>This is a fan page for Marvel's Iron Man.  Here you can find images and bios for Marvel's Iron Man.  I will cover both Tony Stark and Ri Ri Williams (Iron Heart).  I will also include links to popular comics featuring Iron Man and Iron Heart.</p>

	<p>Here I want to explore different ways to include external links and menu options.  Menu options will include the following:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>bio</li>
		<li>images</li>
		<li>comics</li>
		<li>films and TV shows with links to watch</li>
		<li>video clips</li>
		<li>other media appearences</li>
	</ol>
